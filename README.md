## _How to test it_

For you to test this project, you should use the following way:

```c
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
```
Just in case: file1 and file2 are file names, cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters.

The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:

```c
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```

Example 1:
```c
./pipex infile ``ls -l'' ``wc -l'' outfile
```
Should be the same as:
```c
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile
```

Example 2:
```c
 ./pipex infile ``grep a1'' ``wc -w'' outfile
```
Should be the same as:
```c
< infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile
```
